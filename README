# CORE-V Binutils Development

NOTE: This is NOT the official Binutils repository.

This is the repository for CORE-V Binutils development prior to submitting
for inclusion upstream. It has only one branch:

1. development - this is where the active development continues.
This branch tracks upstream Binutils and incorporates changes for
CORE-V. It should always compile and pass tests.

See https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-sw/tree/master/projects/gnu-tools/2023 for latest report.

# Binutils Infrastructure

This directory contains various GNU compilers, assemblers, linkers, 
debuggers, etc., plus their support routines, definitions, and documentation.

If you are receiving this as part of a GDB release, see the file gdb/README.
If with a binutils release, see binutils/README;  if with a libg++ release,
see libg++/README, etc.  That'll give you info about this
package -- supported targets, how to use it, how to report bugs, etc.

It is now possible to automatically configure and build a variety of
tools with one command.  To build all of the tools contained herein,
run the ``configure'' script here, e.g.:

	./configure 
	make

To install them (by default in /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib, etc),
then do:
	make install

(If the configure script can't determine your type of computer, give it
the name as an argument, for instance ``./configure sun4''.  You can
use the script ``config.sub'' to test whether a name is recognized; if
it is, config.sub translates it to a triplet specifying CPU, vendor,
and OS.)

If you have more than one compiler on your system, it is often best to
explicitly set CC in the environment before running configure, and to
also set CC when running make.  For example (assuming sh/bash/ksh):

	CC=gcc ./configure
	make

A similar example using csh:

	setenv CC gcc
	./configure
	make

REPORTING BUGS: Again, see gdb/README, binutils/README, etc., for info
on where and how to report problems.
